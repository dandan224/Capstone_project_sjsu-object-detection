# capstone_project_sjsu-object-detection
For people with visual disabilities, daily transportation is a tough task that restricts their travel freedom. 
This project aims to build analytics models to recognize five different major outdoor subjects including but not limited to utilities, 
vehicles, bikes, pedestrians and traffic lights to implement an image recognition system that can help with the detection of major 
roadblocks for people who have visual disabilities. Finally, this project plans to apply the image recognition system for smart glasses 
in the field of transportation to improve visual disturbances peopleâ€™s safety and convenience in their daily commute for practical use.
